    <h2 style="font-family: Arial">What is mochi?</h2>
    <p style="font-family: Arial">
      Mochi is a bun-shaped Japanese dessert made from sweet glutinous rice
      flour, or mochigome. It has a soft, chewy texture that is somewhat
      elastic. Mochi is often flavored with matcha (or green tea powder), which
      gives it a light green hue.

        <b>Freeze ice cream balls:</b> Place a piece of parchment paper on a
        cookie sheet. Working quickly, use a small ice cream scoop to scoop ice
        cream balls and place them on the parchment paper. Be sure to pack the
        ice cream tightly in the scooper, leaving a flat edge on the ice cream
        so that it will sit flat on your cookie sheet. Freeze for 1 hour.

      <li style="font-family: Arial">
        <b>Make mochi:</b> Combine flour, sugar, and powdered sugar in a
        microwave safe bowl. Add water and stir well, until smooth. Cover the
        bowl with plastic wrap and microwave mochi dough for 1 minute. Wet your
        spatula to prevent sticking and use your spatula to repeatedly fold the
        mixture. Cover, and microwave again for 1 minute. Fold the dough again
        and microwave for 30 more seconds. The mochi should look slightly shiny
        and if it doesn’t, microwave for 30 more seconds.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li style="font-family: Arial">
        <b>Roll mochi dough into rectangle:</b> Place a piece of parchment paper
        on the counter and dust it with a layer of cornstarch. Use a rubber
        spatula to scrape the mochi dough from the bowl and onto the parchment
        paper (keep in mind that it will be very hot so be careful not to touch
        it). Dust the top of the dough ball with cornstarch. Use a rolling pin
        to roll the mochi dough into a large rectangle, about ¼ inch thick. If
        the dough sticks at all while rolling, continue to dust the top with
        cornstarch to prevent sticking. Place the parchment paper with the
        rolled out dough on it, onto the cookie sheet and refrigerate for 30
        minutes.

      <li style="font-family: Arial">
        <b>Fill mochi with ice cream:</b> Remove the dough from the fridge and
        use a round biscuit cutter (about 3 inches) to cut circles in the dough.
        Your circles need to be big enough to pinch the dough around the ice
        cream. Pick up one circle of dough and gently brush off the cornstarch
        from the top (I like to use a dry pastry brush to do this). Working with
        one scoop of ice cream at a time, (keep the rest in the freezer so they
        don’t melt), place one ice cream scoop in the center of the mochi and
        gently press the dough around the ice cream. Pinch the edges of the
        mochi to seal it. Place mochi on a piece of plastic wrap bringing the
        corners of the plastic wrap to the center and twisting it tightly at the
        top.

      <li style="font-family: Arial">
        <b>Freeze:</b> Place mochi back in the freezer with the rolled plastic
        wrap side down. Continue with remaining dough and ice cream. Freeze
        mochi ice cream for at least 1 hour before eating. Once it’s frozen,
        store it wrapped in the plastic wrap and in a freezer safe bag or
        container in the freezer for up to 3 months. Allow the dough to thaw
        slightly before eating.
